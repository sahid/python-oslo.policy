    Added the option to define a more descriptive policy rule by using
    `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class. When using this class it is required
    that the description and operations parameters are defined, unlike
    `policy.RuleDefault`. The operations parameter is a list of dictionaries
    that must contain the two keys 'path' and 'method' which represent the API
    URL and the HTTP REQUEST METHOD. More information can be
    found in the `policy usage documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.policy/usage.html>`_.
