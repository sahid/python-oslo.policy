    A new configuration option has been added to the ``[oslo_policy]`` group
    called ``enforce_scope``. When set to ``True``, oslo.policy will raise an
    ``InvalidScope`` exception if the context passed into the enforce method
    doesn't match the policy's ``scope_types``. If ``False``, a warning will be
    logged for operators. Note that operators should only enable this option
    once they've audited their users to ensure system users have roles on the
    system. This could potentially prevent some users from being able to make
    system-level API calls. This will also give other services the flexibility
    to fix long-standing RBAC issues in OpenStack once they start introducing
    ``scope_types`` for policies used in their service.
