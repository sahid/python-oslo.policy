    [`bug 1779172 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1779172>`_]
    The ``enforce()`` method now supports the ability to parse ``oslo.context``
    objects if passed into ``enforce()`` as ``creds``. This provides more
    consistent policy enforcement for service developers by ensuring the
    attributes provided in policy enforcement are standardized. In this case
    they are being standardized through the
    ``oslo_context.context.RequestContext.to_policy_values()`` method.
